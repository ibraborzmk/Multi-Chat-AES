The AESenc class provides methods for encrypting and decrypting messages using the AES algorithm, along with the ability to generate an AES secret key. The class includes constants for the encryption algorithm and key size, and its methods include encrypting a message, decrypting encrypted data, and generating a secret key. The main method serves for testing encryption and decryption by generating a key, encrypting a message, and then decrypting it. The class is primarily used to secure messages exchanged between the server and clients, showcasing the application of AES for data encryption.

The Client class functions as the main client-side component, managing the graphical interface, user interactions, server communication, and encrypted message handling. It includes attributes for socket communication, interface components, and user details. The class encapsulates the entire client logic, handling user interactions, and ensuring message security through AES encryption.

The Server class represents the central server managing connections with clients. It utilizes the Transaction class to handle each client-server interaction. The class includes attributes for socket communication, transactions, server configuration, and an interface. Methods involve initializing the server interface, running the server, handling user actions, and managing online users. The Server class is responsible for coordinating client connections, transactions, and online user management.

The SocketConnection interface establishes a standard contract for classes managing socket connections in a Java network application. It defines methods for communication and proper closure of socket connections, promoting modular and flexible design for network communication.

The SynchList class represents a synchronized list of ObjectOutputStream instances, facilitating the server's management of multiple client connections concurrently. It provides methods for accessing, adding, removing, and obtaining the size of the list.

The Transaction class handles the communication and coordination of messages between the server and a client. It involves attributes for socket communication, transactions, messages, and online users. Methods include running the transaction, handling communication, managing client departure, and closing connections. The Transaction class ensures independent communication with each client and takes special actions when a client leaves the conversation.

The Message class is a Java class representing a network message, designed for secure chat applications. It includes attributes for the sender's name, message content, recipient, encryption key, and online users. Methods include getters, setters, and a toString method. The Message class is used to encapsulate message information, providing methods for accessing and manipulating this information in a secure communication context.
